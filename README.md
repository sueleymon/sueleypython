In this project, I conducted an in-depth data analysis for Instacart, a leading online grocery store operating through a mobile app. The primary focus was to uncover insights into customer behaviors and preferences, enabling the development of targeted marketing strategies. Instacart sought to improve its marketing campaigns, boost sales, and enhance customer engagement.
Key Questions:
1. Find out the busiest days of the week and hours of the day with the most orders in order to schedule the ads.
2. They also wanted to know when people spend the most money during the day.
3. Another objective was to find out simpler price ranges to direct their efforts
4. Find out if certain types of products are more popular than others. So the marketing team can find out which departments have the most orders.
5. The marketing and sales team is interested in different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviour differs.

This project aimed to provide actionable insights to the Vice President of Marketing and Senior Vice President of Sales at Instacart. The analysis informs the improvement of targeted marketing campaigns, sales optimization, and the delivery of personalized ads and promotions to Instacart's diverse customer base.
This project highlights my proficiency in data analysis and my ability to derive meaningful insights that drive business growth and enhance the customer experience.
